-- PLTO — Migration 012: Server-side billing access enforcement
--
-- Problem: the trial/retention paywall (Billing.isExpired() / showPaywall())
-- is enforced ONLY in the browser. RLS on operational tables checks
-- tenant_id = get_my_tenant_id() but NOT billing status — so an
-- authenticated user whose trial has expired can still read/write their
-- tenant's leads/properties/tasks/etc. directly via the Supabase client
-- (e.g. from the browser console), bypassing the documented business rule
-- "data is preserved for 30 extra days, but the system cannot be used."
--
-- Fix: gate the existing "tenant isolation" policies on operational tables
-- with an additional tenant_access_active() check. This does NOT delete or
-- touch any data — it only blocks reads/writes once trial_ends_at has
-- passed and the tenant hasn't subscribed (mirrors Billing.isExpired()).
-- agent_users is intentionally left untouched — it's account/session
-- metadata needed for login and tenant resolution, not "using the CRM".
