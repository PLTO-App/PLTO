-- PLTO — Migration 010: register_demo_agent() bootstrap function
--
-- Backfilled into the repo to match what is actually live (this file was
-- missing from supabase/migrations/ even though the function existed in
-- the database — verified via list_migrations against project
-- scyfywvzoogfrlalgftv, version 20260603165242).
--
-- ⚠️ This is the ORIGINAL definition as applied. It was found to grant
-- EXECUTE to `anon` (Postgres grants EXECUTE to PUBLIC by default on
-- CREATE FUNCTION unless explicitly revoked) and to trust a
-- client-supplied p_email for identity binding — both fixed by
-- migration 013_lock_down_register_demo_agent.sql. Kept here verbatim
-- for an accurate history of what shipped and when.
